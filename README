ProcessTags 1.0.1 for Movable Type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Process Tags is a plugin originally from Kalsey Consulting Group that creates 
a new global tag attribute called process_tags. A global tag attribute is a MT 
tag attribute that can be used on any tag. You’ve probably seen and used the 
built-in global attributes like encode_html and dirify.

By using the process_tags attribute, you tell Movable Type to process all the 
MT tags that are contained in whatever tag you use it on. So for example, 
if you have included MT template tags in your entry body, you can use 
<mt:EntryBody process_tags="1"> to make sure that those tags get used 
when the entry is built.

Installation
============
This version of ProcessTags requires Movable Type version 4 or later.

1.  Copy the ProcessTags folder into your Movable Type plugins directory.
    If you don't have a plugins directory, create an empty directory
    named "plugins" in your MT server root, and put ProcessTags inside
    that new directory. In other words, your installation should look
    like this:

    (MT home)/plugins/ProcessTags

2.  Copy the contents of the ProcessTags folder in mt-static to your
    mt-static/plugins/ subfolder.

    (MT home)/mt-static/plugins/ProcessTags

3.  Edit your blog templates. A good example of how you might use this
    plugin would be to allow processing of MT tags inside the body of
    an entry. To do this:

      <mt:EntryBody>

    becomes

      <mt:EntryBody process_tags="1">

    Easy! Ditto for any other tags where this might apply. But be careful
    since you're potentially opening up a can of worms considering the 
    power available by exposing Movable Type's template code outside of
    the context of the behind the scenes templates!

    You're done.
